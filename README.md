## 🚀 Advanced Architecture Principles

### 1. Immutable Core & Determinism
Unlike mutable installations, this setup leverages **Nix Flakes** to ensure the environment remains identical across any hardware. Atomic rollbacks guarantee zero-downtime on configuration failures.

### 2. Orchestration & Virtualization
Optimization of the **WSL2 + Docker** virtualization layer. Fine-tuning of the network subsystem for low-latency and optimized filesystem access via **VirtioFS**.

### 3. Defense in Depth
As a professional focused on **PMESP** standards, defense is integrated into the design via the **Least Privilege Principle** and continuous change auditing.
